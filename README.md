# Youtube-Live-Chat-Capture
ElectronJS Application to record chat from live YouTube video

## Setup Instructions
- Clone project
- npm install
- npm start

NOTE: Currently this branch is non-functional as I need to determine how to satisfy the Google Api domain requirements with an electron app. To anyone wanting to help, the only example I have is [hangupsjs](https://github.com/yakyak/hangupsjs). Any help is appreciated!
